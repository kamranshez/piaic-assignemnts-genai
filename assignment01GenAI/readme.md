# Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and outline the five steps to achieve super-intelligence.

AGI is a type of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. Unlike specialized AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI exhibits the flexibility and adaptability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.

Level 1. Chatbots:

- AI with conversational language capabilities.
- Examples: ChatGPT, virtual assistants.

Level 2. Reasoners:

- AI with human-level problem-solving abilities.
- Comparable to a human with a PhD, even without access to textbooks.
- We're currently moving toward this level.
- Next-gen models like GPT-5 are expected to achieve this.

Level 3. Agents:

- Systems capable of taking actions on behalf of users.
- Enables real-world, unsupervised decision-making.
- Use cases: Driverless vehicles, autonomous robots, personal assistants.

Level 4. Innovators:

- AI that aids in invention and discovery.
- Creative problem-solving and novel solutions.
- Pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Level 5. Organizations:

- AI that can perform work at an organizational scale.
- Handling complex tasks across various domains.
- Integration into business processes.
