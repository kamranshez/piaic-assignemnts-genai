# What are Compound AI Systems?

Compound AI systems are advanced frameworks that combine multiple AI models or components, enabling them to work together to handle complex tasks. These systems leverage the strengths of different AI models to create more capable and versatile solutions than a single model could achieve alone.

# What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous entities that interact with their environment, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. They can process information, learn from it, and adapt their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions, often operating within larger AI systems.

# What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?

The relationship between compound AI systems and AI agents lies in their collaboration. AI agents often function as individual components within compound AI systems, working together with other agents or models to accomplish more complex objectives than they could manage on their own.

# What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?

Fine-tuning involves retraining a pre-trained AI model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances a model’s outputs by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external sources, without altering the model’s core training.
